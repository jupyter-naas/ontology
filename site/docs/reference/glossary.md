# Glossary

Definitions of key terms used throughout the Naas Ontology.

## A

**ABI (Agentic Brain Infrastructure)**
: The AI-specific extension layer of the Naas Ontology that provides concepts for AI agents, workflows, and cognitive processes.

**Agent**
: An independent continuant that is capable of performing actions. In AI contexts, includes both human users and artificial intelligence systems.

**AI Agent**
: An artificial intelligence system capable of autonomous decision-making and task execution.

## B

**BFO (Basic Formal Ontology)**
: A top-level ontology that provides foundational categories for systematically organizing all entities that exist or can exist.

**Bearer**
: An entity that has or carries qualities, roles, or other dependent entities.

## C

**CCO (Common Core Ontologies)**
: Mid-level ontologies that extend BFO with practical concepts common across many domains.

**Cognitive Capability**
: A realizable entity that represents a cognitive ability of an AI system, such as reasoning, analysis, or processing.

**Continuant**
: An entity that persists through time while maintaining its identity.

## D

**Dependent Continuant**
: A continuant that depends on other entities for its existence.

**Disposition**
: A realizable entity that represents a tendency or capacity to behave in certain ways under specific conditions.

## E

**Entity**
: The most general category in BFO - anything that exists, has existed, or will exist.

## F

**Foundry**
: An organizational context for curating and managing ontological concepts.

**Function**
: A realizable entity that represents the intended purpose or role of an entity.

## G

**Generically Dependent Continuant**
: A continuant that depends on other entities but not on any specific individual entity. Represents information and knowledge structures.

## I

**Independent Continuant**
: A continuant that does not depend on other entities for its existence. Includes material entities.

**Information Entity**
: A generically dependent continuant that carries semantic content about other entities.

## M

**Material Entity**
: An independent continuant that exists in space and has material parts.

## O

**Object**
: A material entity with clear boundaries that maintains its identity through time.

**Occurrent**
: An entity that happens, unfolds, or develops through time.

## P

**Process**
: An occurrent that has temporal parts and unfolds through time.

**Process-Centric Routing**
: An AI routing approach that selects agents based on cognitive processes needed rather than specific AI models.

## Q

**Quality**
: A specifically dependent continuant that characterizes its bearer.

## R

**Realizable Entity**
: A specifically dependent continuant that represents potentials, capabilities, roles, or functions that can be actualized.

**Role**
: A realizable entity that exists because its bearer is in special circumstances.

## S

**Specifically Dependent Continuant**
: A continuant that depends on specific individual entities for its existence.

**Spatial Region**
: An occurrent that represents locations and spatial relationships.

## T

**Temporal Region**
: An occurrent that represents time intervals and temporal relationships.

**Trigger**
: An event or condition that initiates AI system processes or workflows.

## W

**Workflow**
: A planned sequence of AI processes designed to achieve specific objectives.

## Notation Conventions

**IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier)**
: Unique identifiers for ontological concepts, e.g., `bfo:BFO_0000001` for Entity.

**Turtle Syntax**
: A compact syntax for RDF used in ontology examples throughout this documentation.

**7 Buckets Framework**
: BFO's systematic categorization: WHAT/WHO (materials), HOW-IT-IS (qualities), WHY-POTENTIAL (realizable), HOW-IT-HAPPENS (process), WHEN (time), WHERE (space), HOW-WE-KNOW (information).
