# Occurrent

**Definition:** An entity that happens, unfolds, or develops through time.

**Parent:** [BFO Entity](/bfo)

**See also:** [Continuant](/bfo/continuant) (entities that persist through time)

## Modeling Notes

- Occurrents are temporal entities that happen rather than persist
- They have temporal parts and unfold through time intervals
- Include processes, events, and temporal/spatial regions
- Essential for modeling AI activities, workflows, and temporal reasoning
- Provide the framework for understanding "HOW-IT-HAPPENS"

## BFO Slim - Core Subcategories

### Processes (HOW-IT-HAPPENS)
- **[Process](/bfo/occurrent/Process)** - Activities and workflows

### Temporal Regions (WHEN)
- **[Temporal Region](/bfo/occurrent/temporal-region/TemporalRegion)** - Time intervals and temporal boundaries

### Spatial Regions (WHERE)
- **[Spatial Region](/bfo/occurrent/spatial-region/SpatialRegion3D)** - Locations and spatial boundaries
