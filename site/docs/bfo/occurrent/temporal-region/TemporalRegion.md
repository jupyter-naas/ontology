# Temporal Region

**Definition:** An occurrent that is a temporal interval or temporal instant.

**Parent:** [Occurrent](/bfo/occurrent)

**See also:** [Spatial Region](/bfo/occurrent/spatial-region/SpatialRegion3D), [Process](/bfo/occurrent/Process)

## Modeling Notes

- Temporal regions represent the "WHEN" aspect of BFO's 7 buckets framework
- They provide the temporal framework for when processes occur
- Include both temporal intervals (durations) and temporal instants (moments)
- Essential for modeling AI process timing, scheduling, and temporal reasoning
- Can be measured and have temporal boundaries

## Examples in AI Context

- Execution time windows for AI processes
- Scheduled workflow intervals
- Response time measurements
- Model training durations
- System uptime periods
