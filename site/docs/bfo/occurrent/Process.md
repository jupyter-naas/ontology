# Process

**Definition:** An occurrent that has temporal parts and unfolds through time.

**Parent:** [Occurrent](/bfo/occurrent)

**See also:** [Temporal Region](/bfo/occurrent/temporal-region/TemporalRegion), [Spatial Region](/bfo/occurrent/spatial-region/SpatialRegion3D)

## Modeling Notes

- Processes represent the "HOW-IT-HAPPENS" aspect of BFO's 7 buckets
- They have participants (continuants) and unfold over time intervals
- Can have sub-processes and be part of larger processes
- Foundation for AI workflows, reasoning processes, and system activities
- Enable process-centric routing based on cognitive requirements

## Examples in AI Context

- AI inference and reasoning processes
- Knowledge graph construction workflows
- Agent routing and selection processes
- Model training and fine-tuning activities
- Data processing and transformation pipelines
