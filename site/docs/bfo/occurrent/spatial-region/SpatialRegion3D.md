# Spatial Region 3D

**Definition:** A spatial region that has three spatial dimensions.

**Parent:** [Spatial Region](/bfo/occurrent/spatial-region)

**See also:** [Temporal Region](/bfo/occurrent/temporal-region), [Site](/bfo/continuant/site)

## Modeling Notes

- 3D spatial regions represent the "WHERE" aspect of BFO's 7 buckets framework
- They provide the spatial framework for where material entities exist
- Include volumes, areas, and spatial boundaries in three dimensions
- Essential for modeling AI system deployment locations and spatial contexts
- Can be occupied by material entities like AI systems and infrastructure

## Examples in AI Context

- Data center physical locations
- Cloud computing regions and availability zones
- Server rack spatial arrangements
- Network coverage areas
- Geographic service boundaries
