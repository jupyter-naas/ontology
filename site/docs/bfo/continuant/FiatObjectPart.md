# Fiat Object Part

**Definition:** A material entity that is part of an object but lacks clear physical boundaries.

**Parent:** [Material Entity](/bfo/continuant/MaterialEntity)

**See also:** [Object](/bfo/continuant/Object), [Site](/bfo/continuant/Site)

## Modeling Notes

- Fiat object parts are defined by conceptual rather than physical boundaries
- They exist as parts of larger objects but don't have natural divisions
- Important for modeling logical components and abstract divisions
- Used in AI contexts for software components and logical system parts
- Boundaries are determined by function or purpose rather than physical separation

## Examples in AI Context

- Software modules within AI systems
- Logical partitions of data storage
- Functional components of neural networks
- API endpoints within larger services
- Memory regions in computing systems
