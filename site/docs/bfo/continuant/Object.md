## Modeling Notes

- Objects are discrete material entities with clear spatial boundaries
- They maintain identity through time despite potential changes
- Can have parts and be parts of larger objects
- Foundation for modeling AI systems, devices, and infrastructure
- Distinguished from sites by having clear boundaries

## Examples in AI Context

- Individual AI server instances
- Specific computing devices
- AI model files and executables
- Network routers and switches
- Data storage devices
