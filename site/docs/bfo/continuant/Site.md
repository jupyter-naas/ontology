# Site

**Definition:** A material entity that is a spatial region occupied by some material entity.

**Parent:** [Material Entity](/bfo/continuant/MaterialEntity)

**See also:** [Object](/bfo/continuant/Object), [Spatial Region](/bfo/occurrent/spatial-region/SpatialRegion3D)

## Modeling Notes

- Sites are locations or spaces that can be occupied by objects
- They have spatial extent but are defined by their occupancy potential
- Important for modeling deployment locations and operational contexts
- Used in AI contexts for data centers, cloud regions, and service locations
- Can be nested (sites within larger sites)

## Examples in AI Context

- Data center facilities
- Cloud computing regions and zones
- Server rack locations
- Network node positions
- Deployment environments and contexts
