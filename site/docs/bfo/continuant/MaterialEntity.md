## Modeling Notes

- Material entities are the "WHAT/WHO" of BFO's 7 buckets framework
- They exist independently and occupy spatial regions
- Include AI systems, hardware, infrastructure, and physical components
- Can have qualities, participate in processes, and bear roles
- Foundation for modeling AI agents and their material implementations

## Examples in AI Context

- AI server hardware
- Data center infrastructure  
- Physical robots and devices
- Computing clusters
- Network equipment
