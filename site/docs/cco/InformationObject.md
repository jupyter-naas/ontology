## Modeling Notes

- Information Objects are the foundation for all information-bearing entities in CCO
- They can be concretized in various material forms (documents, databases, digital files)
- Essential for modeling AI knowledge representations, datasets, and information systems
- Bridge between abstract information content and material implementations
- Support complex information relationships and dependencies

## Examples in AI Context

- Knowledge graphs and ontologies
- Training datasets and data models
- AI model specifications and configurations
- Documentation and metadata
- Information schemas and data structures

## Key Subclasses

- **Directive Information Content Entity** - Information that prescribes actions
- **Descriptive Information Content Entity** - Information that describes entities
- **Representational Information Content Entity** - Information that represents other entities
