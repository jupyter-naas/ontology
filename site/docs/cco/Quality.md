# Quality

**Definition:** A Specifically Dependent Continuant that is exhibited if it inheres in an entity or is borne by some entity, but is not exhibited if it does not inhere in an entity or is not borne by some entity.

**Parent:** [Specifically Dependent Continuant](/bfo/continuant/SpecificallyDependentContinuant)

**See also:** [Agent](/cco/Agent), [Artifact](/cco/Artifact)

## Modeling Notes

- Qualities are properties that entities possess and can be measured or observed
- They provide the foundation for describing characteristics of agents, artifacts, and processes
- Essential for AI system modeling - performance metrics, capabilities, and attributes
- Can be quantitative (measurable) or qualitative (categorical)
- Support complex quality relationships and dependencies

## Examples in AI Context

- AI model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)
- System reliability and availability qualities
- Data quality attributes (completeness, consistency, accuracy)
- Agent behavioral qualities and characteristics
- Infrastructure performance qualities

## Key Quality Types

- **Relational Quality** - Qualities that depend on relationships with other entities
- **Intrinsic Quality** - Qualities that are inherent to the entity itself
- **Temporal Quality** - Qualities that change over time
- **Measurable Quality** - Qualities that can be quantified
