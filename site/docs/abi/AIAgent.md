**Parent:** [Agent](/cco/Agent)

**See also:** [Workflow](/abi/Workflow), [Cognitive Capability](/design-patterns/realizable-entity-pattern)

## Modeling Notes

- AI Agents extend CCO Agent concepts for artificial intelligence systems
- They can have cognitive capabilities and performance characteristics
- Participate in AI processes and realize specialized roles
- Foundation for process-centric routing based on capabilities
- Can be organized into multi-agent systems and workflows

## Examples

- ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini language models
- Specialized task execution agents
- Multi-modal AI systems
- Reasoning and analysis agents
- Code generation and technical agents

## Key Properties

- **Cognitive Capabilities** - Truth-seeking, ethical reasoning, multimodal processing
- **Performance Metrics** - Intelligence scores, response speed, cost efficiency
- **Roles** - Primary responder, fallback handler, specialized executor
- **System Integration** - Load balancing, API endpoints, model registries
