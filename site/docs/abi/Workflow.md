# Workflow

**Definition:** A planned sequence of AI processes and activities designed to achieve specific objectives.

**Parent:** [Plan](/cco/Plan)

**See also:** [Trigger](/abi/Trigger), [AI Agent](/abi/AIAgent)

## Modeling Notes

- Workflows orchestrate multiple AI agents and processes
- They can be triggered by events or scheduled execution
- Include sequential, parallel, and conditional execution patterns
- Foundation for complex AI system coordination
- Can adapt based on context and performance metrics

## Examples

- Multi-agent collaboration workflows
- Data processing and analysis pipelines
- Knowledge graph construction workflows
- AI model training and deployment processes
- User request routing and handling workflows

## Key Properties

- **Execution Pattern** - Sequential, parallel, conditional, or hybrid
- **Trigger Conditions** - Events or schedules that initiate workflow
- **Participant Agents** - AI agents involved in workflow execution
- **Success Criteria** - Conditions that define successful completion
- **Error Handling** - Fallback strategies and recovery mechanisms
