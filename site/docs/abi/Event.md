# Event

**Definition:** A process that represents a significant occurrence or change in state within AI systems.

**Parent:** [Process](/bfo/occurrent/Process)

**See also:** [Trigger](/abi/Trigger), [Workflow](/abi/Workflow)

## Modeling Notes

- Events represent discrete occurrences that can trigger system responses
- They have specific temporal boundaries and can carry information
- Important for event-driven AI architectures and reactive systems
- Can be generated by user actions, system processes, or external sources
- Foundation for monitoring, logging, and system coordination

## Examples

- User interaction events (queries, clicks, submissions)
- System state change events (startup, shutdown, error)
- Data processing completion events
- AI model inference completion events
- Workflow milestone and completion events

## Key Properties

- **Event Type** - Classification of the event (user, system, external)
- **Event Data** - Information payload carried by the event
- **Timestamp** - When the event occurred
- **Source** - What generated or caused the event
- **Severity Level** - Importance or criticality of the event
