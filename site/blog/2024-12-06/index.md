Itâ€™s because a flywheel is all about momentum. When you combine AI and ontologies, every action should build on the previous one, creating a system that gets smarter and more efficient over time.

Ontologies structure your data so that insights are reusable, workflows are scalable, and knowledge compounds. Each interaction whether itâ€™s a user input, feedback, or new data feeds back into the system, improving AI performance and making the entire process smoother.

Think of it as a loop: AI generates insights, the ontology organizes them, and the system uses that structure to deliver better outcomes. Over time, this momentum reduces friction, scales easily across use cases, and creates sustainable, long-term value.

Now, take a look at this diagram below, itâ€™s a representation of ABI our organizational AI-powered ontology system that operates as a flywheel:

1) Core assistants as drivers: at the center, you have six specialized assistants (Growth, Sales, Operations, Content, Finance, and Open Data). Each assistant focuses on a key part of the organization, generating insights and actions that feed into the system.

2) Interconnected entities: surrounding the assistants are key domain ontologies like People, Companies, Deals, and Tasks. These nodes form feedback loops, ensuring that every interaction strengthens the system. For example, data from interactions on LinkedIn flows into the Growth Assistant, which creates insights that drive Sales activities.

3) Outer ecosystem of inputs: Platforms like LinkedIn, Google, Stripe, and AWS provide the external data and tools needed to fuel the flywheel. As this data is structured by ontologies, it seamlessly integrates into workflows and powers decision-making.

The flywheel effect ensures that the system scales effortlessly across domains, reduces friction in processes, and continuously improves. Every input whether itâ€™s a new interaction, task, or dataset creates a ripple that accelerates revenue and cost efficiency.

In short, the flywheel mindset helps you focus on creating systems where every step adds to a cycle of growth and efficiency.
